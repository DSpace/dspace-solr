This is a special build of Apache Solr for DSpace (http://www.dspace.org).

This build is just a Maven WAR Overlay of the default Apache Solr Web application.
This Overlay adds the following DSpace customizations:

* A new 'org.dspace.solr.filters.LocalHostRestrictionFilter' class (which restricts Solr access to localhost)
* Customizes the default web.xml to utilize this new LocalHostRestrictionFilter

For more information about Maven WAR Overlays see:
http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-war-plugin/overlays.html

This project has been created under an alternate groupId to 
be supported within the DSpace community and distributed 
within the 'org.dspace' groupId.
